# Tax Reporting Engine & Module Safety Audit

---

## 1. DB Session & Dependency Injection
- **All FastAPI tax routes** (`server/routes/tax.py`) use `Depends(get_db)` for DB session injection and `Depends(get_current_user)` for user context.
- **TypeScript/Node tax services** (`tax-calculation-service.ts`, `nz-tax-service.ts`) use Prisma's per-request context; no global or unsafe session reuse detected.

---

## 2. JSON/CSV/Report Output & Validation
- **All JSON responses** use Pydantic response models (e.g., `TaxSummary`, `TaxTransactionResponse`, `TaxReportResponse`) or explicit schemas (TypeScript).
- **CSV export** (`/tax/export/csv`) builds output in-memory and streams via FastAPI's `StreamingResponse`â€”no unsafe file writes.
- **IR3 and other report endpoints** return structured JSON, with all fields present and validated.
- **TypeScript routes** validate request/query params with Zod schemas and handle errors with try/catch.

---

## 3. Error Handling & Empty/Malformed Data
- **All DB queries** check for empty results and return mock/demo data or empty objects if needed (never crash on empty DB).
- **Malformed or missing input** (e.g., missing tax year) triggers HTTP 400 or 500 with clear error messages.
- **No evidence of unhandled exceptions** that would crash the app on empty or malformed data.

---

## 4. Hardcoded Values & File Safety
- **No unsafe file writes**: All report generation is in-memory (JSON, CSV, or response objects).
- **Some demo/mock data** is hardcoded for empty DB/test/demo flows (e.g., sample transactions, IRD number in IR3 report), but these are clearly marked and do not affect real user data.
- **No hardcoded file paths or OS-level writes** found in any reporting or tax module.

---

## 5. Recommendations
- Replace demo/mock data with real data in production.
- Consider adding persistent audit logging for report generation and export events.
- Validate all user-supplied parameters (e.g., country, tax year) before DB queries.
- Remove or secure any hardcoded identifiers (e.g., IRD number) before production deployment.
