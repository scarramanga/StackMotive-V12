# PHASE 4 — Background Task & Strategy Engine Safety Audit

## 📁 server/logic/signal_engine.py
- ✅ No use of `SessionLocal()` or direct DB sessions
- ✅ All logic is in-memory/mock; no DB access or background jobs detected

## 📁 server/routes/strategy.py
- ✅ No background tasks or jobs found
- ✅ All DB access (if any) is via FastAPI request context and `Depends(get_db)`
- ✅ No direct use of `SessionLocal()`

## 📁 server/routes/paper_trading.py
- ✅ No background tasks or jobs found
- ✅ All DB access is via `Depends(get_db)`
- ✅ No direct use of `SessionLocal()`

## 📁 server/routes/market_data.py, server/routes/market_events.py, server/routes/trades.py, server/routes/watchlist.py
- ✅ No background tasks, jobs, or DB access found
- ✅ All endpoints are stateless or use mock data

---

## 🔍 What was checked:
- Any direct use of `SessionLocal()` (none found outside `server/database.py`)
- Any background/async jobs or strategy engine runs (none found using DB sessions)
- Any session usage outside request context (none found)
- Any unclosed or unsafe session handling (none found)

---

### 🟢 Summary
- **No background tasks, jobs, or strategy engine code** in your backend directly uses `SessionLocal()` or manages DB sessions unsafely.
- **All DB access** is handled via FastAPI dependency injection (`Depends(get_db)`), which is safe and per-request.
- **No session leaks or unsafe patterns** were found in the strategy engine or any background logic.

**If you have other files (e.g., `tasks.py`, `engine.py`, or Celery/async jobs) not covered here, please specify their paths for further audit.**  
Otherwise, your background and strategy logic is currently safe with respect to SQLAlchemy session management.
