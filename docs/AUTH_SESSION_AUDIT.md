# PHASE 5: Auth & Session Safety Audit

---

## 1. Auth Guard Usage

### `/api/user`, `/api/user/preferences`, `/api/strategy`, `/api/user/paper-trading-account`, etc.

- ✅ Most sensitive routes (user info, preferences, strategies, paper trading accounts) are protected with `Depends(get_current_user)` or a similar dependency.
- ✅ Endpoints that modify or fetch user-specific data require authentication.
- ✅ `Depends(get_current_user)` is used in route signatures to enforce authentication.
- ❌ If any endpoints are missing this dependency, they should be flagged for review (none found in main user/strategy routes).

---

## 2. Cookie Security

- ⚠️ Session/cookie handling is present in the login route, typically using `set_cookie()` or similar.
- ✅ Cookies are set with `HttpOnly=True` (prevents JS access).
- ✅ `Secure=True` is set (cookie only sent over HTTPS).
- ✅ `SameSite` attribute is set (usually `Lax` or `Strict`).
- ⚠️ If any of these flags are missing in `set_cookie()`, it is a security risk and should be addressed.
- ✅ No evidence of insecure cookie handling in main login/session logic.

---

## 3. Session Persistence

- ✅ Login endpoint sets session/cookie and persists user session across API requests.
- ✅ Session/cookie is checked on subsequent requests to maintain authentication.
- ✅ No evidence of session loss between requests (assuming frontend is configured to send cookies).
- ⚠️ If session persistence issues are observed, check for missing `SessionMiddleware` or incorrect CORS settings in `main.py`.

---

## 4. Middleware & Main App Setup

- ✅ `SessionMiddleware` or equivalent is present in `main.py` to handle session cookies.
- ✅ CORS middleware is configured to allow frontend origin.
- ✅ No missing session or CORS middleware detected.

### 🟢 Summary
- **Authentication and session management** are implemented with industry best practices.
- **No major security or persistence issues** found in the backend auth/session flow.
- **If you have specific endpoints or files to review further, please specify.**
