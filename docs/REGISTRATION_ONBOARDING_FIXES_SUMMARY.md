## 🎯 **Problem Statement**
Based on the field audit in `STACKMOTIVE_FIELD_AUDIT.md`, the registration form was collecting inappropriate fields that belonged in the onboarding flow, creating UX confusion and data flow issues.

- ❌ `tradingExperience` (moved to onboarding)

**KEPT core authentication fields:**
- ✅ `email` (required, validated)

**Enhanced completion handler:**
