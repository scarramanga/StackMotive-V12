WebSocket Trace - Phase 16.2 Diagnostics:
Timestamp: 2025-10-10T03:38:00.000Z

DIAGNOSTIC FINDINGS:
===================

Issue: Protocol mismatch between client and server
- Client: Native WebSocket (ws://) in client/src/hooks/use-websocket.ts
- Server: Socket.IO protocol in server/websocket_server.py

Test Results:
- Socket.IO client → ✅ SUCCESS (connect handler fires, JWT validated, connection accepted)
- Native WebSocket → ❌ FAIL (400 Bad Request, connect handler never invoked)

Root Cause: Native WebSocket and Socket.IO are incompatible protocols

Backend Validation: @sio.event("connect") handler IS properly registered and DOES execute
when using Socket.IO protocol. JWT verification works correctly when called.

Status: Diagnostic phase complete. Backend works as designed. Client needs to use
socket.io-client library instead of native WebSocket API.

See docs/audit/README_PHASE16.md for complete analysis.
