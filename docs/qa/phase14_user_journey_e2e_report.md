# Phase 14: User Journey E2E Test Report

**Date**: October 08, 2025  
**Tester**: Devin AI  
**Build**: StackMotive V12 (main branch, PR #29)  
**Spec**: StackMotive V12 Complete User Flow / Journey Specification  
**Devin Run**: https://app.devin.ai/sessions/ea257b2dd7474764bf84e49751ba278c

## Executive Summary

Manual E2E testing attempted for StackMotive V12 against the 11 user journey areas. Testing was severely limited by a critical authentication system blocker that prevented comprehensive validation of authenticated user flows.

**Overall Status**: BLOCKED - 1/11 areas PARTIAL PASS, 10/11 areas BLOCKED/FAIL

### Critical Blocker
**Authentication System Completely Non-Functional**: Backend API endpoints for user registration and authentication return 404 errors, preventing any authenticated user journey testing.

### Critical Gaps Found
1. **Authentication System**: Backend `/api/auth/register` returns 404, `/api/health` returns 404 ❌
2. **Database Schema**: Missing `username` column required by frontend registration form ❌
3. **Tier Tourism (5-minute preview)**: NOT IMPLEMENTED ❌ (expected per spec)
4. **Magic Link Authentication**: NOT IMPLEMENTED ❌ (expected per spec)
5. **User Onboarding APIs**: All `/api/onboarding/*` endpoints return 501 Not Implemented ❌

---

## Journey Area 1: New User Registration & Onboarding
**Status**: FAIL ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_01_new_user.cy.ts` (created but cannot run)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ Registration flow - BLOCKED by backend 404 errors
- ❌ Auto-login after registration - BLOCKED
- ❌ Redirect to /onboarding - BLOCKED
- ❌ Portfolio import - BLOCKED

### Root Cause Analysis
**Backend API Missing:**
```
POST /api/auth/register → 404 Not Found
POST /api/register → 422 Unprocessable Entity (schema mismatch)
GET /api/health → 404 Not Found
```

**Database Schema Mismatch:**
- Frontend registration form expects `username` field
- Database `users` table has: `id, email, hashed_password, is_active, has_completed_onboarding`
- Database `users` table missing: `username` column

**Evidence:**
- Backend logs: `{"method": "POST", "path": "/api/auth/register", "status": 404}`
- Database query: `SELECT * FROM users;` returns 0 rows
- Screenshot: Login page loads correctly (frontend works)
- Evidence file: `docs/qa/evidence/backend_health_404.png`

### Impact
**CRITICAL**: Cannot test ANY authenticated user journeys without working registration/login

---

## Journey Area 2: Stack AI Onboarding  
**Status**: BLOCKED ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_02_stack_ai_onboarding.cy.ts` (created but cannot run)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ Stack AI Q&A flow - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)
- ❌ Experience level questions - BLOCKED
- ❌ Tier recommendation - BLOCKED
- ❌ Portfolio import prompts - BLOCKED

### Root Cause
Cannot create authenticated user to test onboarding flow. Backend onboarding APIs return 501 Not Implemented:
```
GET /api/onboarding/steps → 501 Not Implemented
GET /api/onboarding/progress → 501 Not Implemented
```

### Code Analysis (Not Tested)
From code review, if authentication worked:
- ⚠️ AI orchestrator exists but conversational command execution appears limited
- ⚠️ Onboarding routes return 501 status
- ❌ Full conversational AI (commands, general queries) appears not implemented

### Impact
Cannot verify Stack AI onboarding flow without working authentication

---

## Journey Area 3: Experienced User Fast Track
**Status**: BLOCKED ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/full_stackmotive_user_flow.cy.ts` (existing)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ Skip onboarding - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)
- ❌ Direct tier selection - BLOCKED
- ❌ Fast dashboard setup - BLOCKED
- ❌ Returning user redirect - BLOCKED

### Root Cause
Cannot test fast-track flow without ability to create and authenticate users

---

## Journey Area 4: Tier Selection & Billing
**Status**: BLOCKED ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_04_tier_billing.cy.ts` (created but cannot run)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ Tier comparison UI - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)
- ❌ Stripe payment flow - BLOCKED
- ❌ Webhook verification - BLOCKED
- ❌ Tier enforcement - BLOCKED

### Code Review Findings (Not Tested)
From code analysis, tier system appears implemented:
- ✅ `tier_enforcement.py` middleware exists
- ✅ Tier hierarchy defined: Observer/Participant/Builder/Sovereign
- ✅ Rate limiting configured per tier
- ⚠️ Stripe integration configured but not testable

### Root Cause
Cannot test billing flow without authenticated user session

---

**Status**: PARTIAL ⚠️  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_05_live_dashboard.cy.ts` (created but cannot run with auth)

### Tests Executed (Without Authentication)
- ✅ Frontend pages render correctly with mock data
- ✅ Reports page displays mock portfolio metrics
- ✅ Analytics page shows sample performance data
- ❌ Real portfolio data - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)
- ❌ WebSocket notifications - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)
- ❌ Redis cache behavior - BLOCKED (requires authenticated user)

### Evidence Collected
- **Screenshot**: `docs/qa/evidence/journey_08_reports_page.png` - Reports page with mock data showing portfolio value $65,715.50, win rate 72.0%, strategy performance charts

- **Screenshot**: `docs/qa/evidence/journey_settings_load_error.png` - Settings page shows "Failed to load preferences" error

### Frontend Validation
✅ **Router context issues RESOLVED**: Changed ThemeAnimator components from react-router-dom to wouter, added defensive try-catch guards
✅ **Pages render without crashes**: Login, Settings, Reports, Analytics all load correctly
❌ **Backend APIs incomplete**: User preferences return 500 errors, most authenticated endpoints return 404

### Impact
Frontend infrastructure works, but cannot test real dashboard flows without authentication

---

## Journey Area 10: Tier Tourism (5-minute Preview)
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_10_tier_tourism.cy.ts` (created as failing test)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ 5-minute tier preview timer - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ Server-side temporary elevation - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ Client-side countdown UI - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ Post-expiry lockback - NOT IMPLEMENTED

### Gap Details
**Expected (from spec)**: "5-minute preview of higher-tier features before locking back to current tier with in-context upsell"

**Actual State (Code Review):**
- ❌ Only 30-day trial system found (`use-trial-status.ts`)
- ❌ No 5-minute temporary elevation mechanism
- ❌ No server-side timer for preview sessions
- ❌ No `tier_preview_sessions` table in database
- ❌ `tier_enforcement.py` has no preview session logic

**Severity**: MAJOR - Core monetization feature from spec

**Impact**: Expected gap per user instructions. Needs GitHub issue with implementation proposal.

## Journey Area 11: Returning User Flow  
**Status**: FAIL ❌  
**Test File**: `client/cypress/e2e/journey_11_returning_user.cy.ts` (created but cannot run)

### Tests Attempted
- ❌ Email/password login - BLOCKED (backend returns 404)
- ❌ Magic link authentication - NOT IMPLEMENTED
- ❌ User preferences persistence - BLOCKED
- ❌ Last view restoration - BLOCKED
- ❌ "Updates since last visit" summary - BLOCKED

### Gap Details
**Expected (from spec)**: "Sign-in methods (Magic link, Email/password), Restore last view, Updates since last visit summary"

**Actual State:**
- ❌ Email/password login backend missing (404 errors)
- ❌ Magic link not implemented (expected gap per user)
- ❌ Cannot test preference persistence without authentication

**Evidence:**
- Backend logs show `/api/auth/register` returns 404
- Database has 0 users, cannot create test user

**Severity**: CRITICAL - Cannot test returning user flow at all

**Impact**: Authentication blocker prevents all returning user flow testing

## Recommendations

### CRITICAL - Fix Authentication System First
**Priority**: URGENT  
**Scope**: Cannot perform comprehensive user journey testing until authentication system is functional

**Required Fixes:**
1. Implement `/api/auth/register` endpoint (currently returns 404)
2. Implement `/api/health` endpoint (currently returns 404)
3. Fix database schema mismatch (add `username` column OR remove from frontend)
4. Implement `/api/onboarding/*` endpoints (currently return 501)
5. Fix `/api/user-preferences` endpoints (currently return 500)

### Small Fixes for PR B (When Auth Works)
1. ✅ Frontend router context issues ALREADY FIXED (changed to wouter, added defensive guards)
2. Document expected failures in README (Tier Tourism, Magic Links not implemented)
3. Add .env.example entries for all required environment variables

### Future Implementation (File GitHub Issues)
1. **Issue #1**: Implement 5-minute tier tourism preview system (MAJOR gap)
2. **Issue #2**: Implement magic link authentication (MAJOR gap)
3. **Issue #3**: Extend Stack AI with command execution layer (MAJOR gap)

## Conclusion

StackMotive V12 has a **critical authentication blocker** that prevented comprehensive user journey testing. After 2+ hours of debugging and testing attempts:

**What Works:**
- ✅ Frontend pages render correctly (login, settings, reports, analytics)
- ✅ Router context issues resolved (migrated to wouter, added defensive guards)
- ✅ Frontend UI displays mock data correctly
- ✅ Test infrastructure created (11 test files, fixtures, Docker setup)
- ✅ PR #29 CI green (13/13 checks passing)

**What's Broken:**
- ❌ **CRITICAL**: Backend authentication completely non-functional
  - `/api/auth/register` returns 404 Not Found
  - `/api/health` returns 404 Not Found
  - `/api/onboarding/*` returns 501 Not Implemented
  - `/api/user-preferences` returns 500 Internal Server Error
- ❌ Database schema missing `username` column
- ❌ Zero users in database, cannot create test users
- ❌ Cannot test ANY authenticated user journeys (10 of 11 journey areas blocked)

**Expected Gaps (From User Instructions):**
- Tier tourism (5-minute preview) not implemented
- Magic link authentication not implemented
- Conversational AI command execution likely incomplete

**Impact:**
Manual E2E testing of the 11 user journeys could not be completed due to the authentication blocker. Only frontend-only testing was possible, capturing 4 screenshots showing that the UI renders correctly with mock data.

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. **FIX AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM** - This is the highest priority blocker
2. Once auth works, resume comprehensive manual testing of all 11 journeys
3. File GitHub issues for expected gaps (Tier Tourism, Magic Links, AI Commands)
4. Create PR B with small fixes identified during testing
